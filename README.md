# Jupyter Notebooks for Data Driven Astronomy

## Introduction

With services such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index), [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), and [Gradient](https://gradient.run/notebooks), now Jupyter notebooks can be hosted and shared online. Users can run shared notebooks without having to install required packages locally on their machines. Although these services come with many pre-installed packages, some newer packages require manual installation routines. 

In this repository, we have created a routine that will allow users to use [SDSS-Marvin](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a python based tool for handling [MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/) data, on Google Colab. The repository comes with Jupyter notebooks with solved Marvin Science Exercises and more. The repository also has [fast.ai](http://fast.ai/) notebooks for Galaxy Morphology Classification and Saliency Mapping for visualization of CNN models.

This repository contains code for the following:

*  H alpha Map overplotted with SDSS g band contours
*  WHAN Map overplotted with SDSS g band contours
*  BPT Map overplotted with SDSS g band contours
*  Metallcity Map overplotted with g band contours
*  ResNet50 Bar Classifier using Galaxy Zoo Kaggle dataset

## Notebooks

* Marvin : [ScienceExercises.ipynb](https://github.com/Jack3690/Kugelblitz/blob/main/ScienceExercises.ipynb)
* Fast.ai : [Bar_Classifier.ipynb](https://github.com/Jack3690/Kugelblitz/blob/main/Bar_Classifier.ipynb)

## Usage
### [ScienceExercises.ipynb](https://github.com/Jack3690/Kugelblitz/blob/main/ScienceExercises.ipynb) [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Jack3690/Kugelblitz/blob/main/ScienceExercises.ipynb)
This notebook can be used to generate Marvin maps with optical contour overplots using Plateifu of MaNGA sources. An example of maps is given below
