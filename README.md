# Jupyter Notebooks for Data Driven Astronomy

## Introduction

This is a repository dedicated to Indian Spectroscopic and Imaging Space Telescope (INSIST) project. It contains Jupyter Notebooks which can be hosted on cloud platforms such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index), [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), and [Gradient](https://gradient.run/notebooks)

This repository contains codes for the following:

*  PSF using catalogs and Casjobs
*  PSF based on different Telescope apertures and obstructions

# WebTools
* PSF Simulation Tool : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Jack3690/Kugelblitz/main?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FPSF_Simulator_Tool.ipynb%3Fvoila-theme%3Ddark) (Work in progress)
 
## Notebooks

* PSF Simulator : [PSF_Simulator.ipynb](https://github.com/Jack3690/Kugelblitz/blob/main/PSF_Simulator.ipynb)



## Usage

### [PSF_Simulator.ipynb](https://github.com/Jack3690/Kugelblitz/blob/main/PSF_Simulator.ipynb) [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Jack3690/Kugelblitz/blob/main/PSF_Simulator.ipynb)
This notebook can be used to understand how to generate Point Spread Functions of sources in a given field using user defined catalogs and CasJobs. A Voila based web tool is also created using same routine which can be accessed here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Jack3690/Kugelblitz/main?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FPSF_Simulator_Tool.ipynb%3Fvoila-theme%3Ddark) (Work in progress)
