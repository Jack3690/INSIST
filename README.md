# Jupyter Notebooks for Data Driven Astronomy

## Introduction

This is a repository dedicated to Indian Spectroscopic and Imaging Space Telescope (INSIST) project. It contains Jupyter Notebooks which can be hosted on cloud platforms such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index), [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), and [Gradient](https://gradient.run/notebooks)

This repository contains codes for the following:

*  PSFs using catalogs and Casjobs
*  PSFs based on different Telescope apertures and obstructions

# Web Tools
* PSF Simulation Tool : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Jack3690/INSIST/main?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FPSF_Simulator_Tool.ipynb%3Fvoila-theme%3Ddark) (Work in progress)
 
## Notebooks
